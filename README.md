### Technical information

HatchetHarry is a Java webapp, the used technology stack consists of:

    - jQuery 1.11.1
    - Atmosphere 2.1.9
    - Wicket 6.18.0
    - Spring 4.1.2
    - Hibernate 4.3.7

The project is built with Maven 3, you should deploy it witout any problem in Tomcat 7 / 8 and Jetty. The used RDBMS is MariaDB 10.1.2 / MySQL 5.5.

The following dependencies of this project are on Github only:

    - wicket-quickview 6.0-SNAPSHOT: a wicket component (RepeatingView) that lets you add or remove the rows without the need to re-render the whole repeater again in Ajax. https://github.com/vineetsemwal/quickview
    - mistletoe 0.3-SNAPSHOT: my own version of this small test tool

Every other dependency is available through Maven Central.

There are file paths to change in order to match your own setup, in the following files:

    - src/main/java/org/alienlabs/hatchetharry/HatchetHarryApplication.properties
    - src/main/java/org/alienlabs/hatchetharry/service/DataGenerator.properties
    - src/main/java/org/alienlabs/hatchetharry/view/page/HomePage.properties
    - src/test/java/org/alienlabs/hatchetharry/integrationTest/FunctionalTests.java line 179 => you have to provide the Selenium Chrome driver for your platform (the one provided in src/main/resources/chromedriver is for Linux)
    - the PMD ruleset paths in the pom.xml (not strictly necessary)
    - src/main/resources/rebel.xml => JRebel configuration file, not strictly necessary. http://zeroturnaround.com/software/jrebel

You will need a database schema called hh in order to run the webapp, and a schema called hhTest in order to run the tests. Please see the files:

	- src/main/resources/applicationContext.xml
	- src/test/resources/applicationContextTest.xml
	
for the username & password.

Some technical tips & tricks can be found in the README file.
